+ Release v2.1
+ Fixed compatibility issues with C++ in general and OpenCV


+ Release v2.0

Version 2 of the Oscar framework introduces a lot of changes and new features, some of which break compatibility with existing applications.

Framework:
+ Simplified framework creation and destruction
+ Totally reworked build process to be able to use the same Makefiles for all modules.
+ Added support for the black-and-white version of leanXcam
+ Easier support of additional board types
+ New macros to help with common problems
	- Memory management in pools
	- Object lists
	- Error handling in TRY-CATCH blocks

Module clb:
- Has been removed for now, due to being in an unusable state.

Module vis:
+ Added assembler-optimized functions for bilinear debayering to vis module. These are much faster than the previously used debayering methods.
+ Added debayering to YUV, chrominance and HSL output images
+ Added very fast debayering methods to half-size.
+ Added many more useful vision functions for:
	- Generic 2D Filters
	- Sobel Filtering
	- Erosion and dilation.
	- Binary Labeling

New module jpg:
+ JPEG encoding


+ Release v1.3-p1

* This fixed some major bugs in the dspl modules which made the host implementation virtually useless.


+ Release v1.3

* Cleaned up the Makefile infrastructure which allows us to only have one generic module Makefile.
* The framework now generates libraries with and without debugging symbols and with and without IO simulation.
* Added a 'MESA_SR4K' target, used for the SwissRanger 4000 by Mesa Imaging.
* Added the 'jpg' module which can be used to encode JPEG images.
* Added the function 'OscSupCycGet64' to read the 64-bit hight-resolution-timer on the blackfin DSP.
* Added a very fast grayscale debayering function 'OscVisVectorDebayerGrey' using DSP vector operations.


+ Release v1.2-p5
Multiple bug-fixes (configuring, timeout)


+ Release v1.2-p4
Add shift-left functions for fract16 and fract2x16


+ Release v1.2-p3
Bugfixes Config-Modul
Reactivate DMA workaround


+ Release v1.2-p2

Minor bug-fixes and extensions.
